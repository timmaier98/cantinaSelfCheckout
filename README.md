# cantinaSelfCheckout

At peak time the mensa at our university is very crowded. We want to solve this Problem.

The goal of the project is to create a self-checkout system for a cantina.\
You have to slide your tablet with the food under a camera. The system detects the food
using a neural network and automatically calculates the cost of everything on the tablet.
