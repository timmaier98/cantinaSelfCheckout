# cantinaSelfCheckout

At peak time the mesa at pur university is very crowded. We want to solve this Problem.

The goal of the project is to create a self-checkout system for a canteen.\
You have to slide your tablet with the food under a camera. The system then detects the food
using a nural network and automatically calculates the cost of all the food on the tablet.
